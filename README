Redmine Wiki R-macro plugin will allow Redmine wiki to render
graphs generated from R code.

The plugin depends on R and xvfb and looks for them in
/usr/bin/xvfb-run and /usr/bin/R respectively.

You need to patch Redmine, otherwise you can't have commas in your R scripts:

Edit lib/redmine/wiki_formatting.rb
In def execute_macros:
$
if macro == 'latex'
args = $5
else
args = ($5 || '').split(',').each(&:strip)
end
$

WARNING: Since the R language has functions to create/modify/delete files
and spawn subprocesses, attackers may use this plugin to compromise your
machine. R and xvfb are started as user "nobody".

Please run "chmod 777 -R tmp/redmine_wiki_r_plugin" to allow the nobody user
to create graph files.
