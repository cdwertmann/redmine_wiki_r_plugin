Redmine Wiki R-macro plugin will allow Redmine wiki to render
graphs generated from R code.

You need to patch Redmine, otherwise you can't have commas in your R scripts:

Edit lib/redmine/wiki_formatting.rb
In def execute_macros:
$
if macro == 'latex'
args = $5
else
args = ($5 || '').split(',').each(&:strip)
end
$
